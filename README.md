- A Spring Boot project structured with multiple layers, designed to handle JSON-formatted product arrays via various requests. It executes CRUD operations on a MongoDB database, ensuring adherence to the business logic embedded within it.
- The system periodically checks for new product feeds from example.com/feeds.json and efficiently processes them to ensure minimal memory usage by streaming the JSON data instead of loading it entirely into memory.
- Products are parsed and inserted into the MongoDB collection, with the “sku” field used as a unique identifier to handle duplicates by updating existing records rather than creating new entries. The solution adheres to business logic requirements and ensures data integrity and efficient processing.
